Path integration in an attractor network model of grid
cells with recurrency through conjunctive cells

Abstract
Over the past years various studies were conducted and research was done on the
topic of spatial navigation inside the brain. More evidence was found describing
functions and behavior of spatial cells, especially grid cells, and how they enable
path integration. These grid cells show no direct connection to each other but
instead use “conjunctive” cells as link. In this thesis I study the way grid cells and
conjunctive cells operate and try to create a continuous attractor network model by
making use of research results focusing on these cells. By starting the implementation of the network one-dimensionial first I take an iterative and intuitive approach at modeling a fully working two-dimensional network.
